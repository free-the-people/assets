# Phoenix Flag

Opponents to the Trump regime and all it represents come from all walks of life, all socio-economic and immigration statuses, all religions, and all races. They have each joined the resistance against authoritarianism for an equally diverse collection of reasons, such as defending the rights of immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, women, the poor, the sick, and the maginalized. Others joined to defend our very democracy by defending public education, federal workers, and the institutions of democracy that have been built over centuries and are now under attack. There are countless other movements and causes that have brought people together to stand against tyranny.

We recommend using depictions of a **phoenix** as a unifying symbol to represent all of these varied causes and movements. The phoenix is a symbol used throughout the world to represent rebirth. In fact, the very first draft of the Great Seal of the United States <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States#Third_committee" target="_blank">featured a phoenix</a> (along with other symbols) to represent the birth of a new nation.

While MAGAts look to their imaginary version of the United States of America's past to Make America Great Again, we know that this country has _never_ lived up to the promises of its founding documents. Instead of looking to the past, we look to the future, hoping the United States of America can be reborn from the ashes of the Trump regime. Maybe this time, we can build a country that acts as if "all [people] are created equal" and government should be "of the people, by the people, and for the people."

Feel free to use the images in this repository without restrictions. If you don't like this representation of a phoenix, feel free to design your own...it's the concept that matters, not the specific image.
